To make this node work, you need to download the Llama.cpp libraries manually from this link:
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases

Download the archive that suits your system. Probably, for you it will be llama-b5317-bin-win--cu12.4-x64.zip

After downloading, go to the path:
ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-LevelPixel-Advanced\nodes\vlm\llama-mtmd-cli\

And UNZIP the downloaded archive here.

The llama-mtmd-cli folder should contain the llama-mtmd-cli.exe file and other libraries from the archive:
ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-LevelPixel-Advanced\nodes\vlm\llama-mtmd-cli\llama-mtmd-cli.exe

After that, run the generation again.
